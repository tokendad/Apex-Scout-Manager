# Venturing

 A co-ed program for young adults (ages 14–20), follows the ALPS model which focuses on Adventure, Leadership, Personal Development, and Service. 

## Ranks
`The program includes four core ranks that must be earned in sequence: `

- **Venturing Rank**: The initial joining rank where a member commits to the crew and learns the program's fundamentals.
- **Discovery Rank:** Focuses on participation and basic skill discovery. Requirements include first aid/CPR training and setting personal goals.
- **Pathfinder Rank**: Emphasizes leadership. Venturers must plan and lead crew activities, serve in a leadership position, and manage projects.
- **Summit Rank**: The highest honor in Venturing, equivalent to the Eagle Scout rank. It requires mentoring others, completing a community service project, and advanced leadership training. 

`Beyond these core ranks, members can earn Specialty Awards to explore specific interests, such as: `

- Ranger Award: For elite outdoor and high-adventure skills.
- Quest Award: Focuses on fitness, sports, and nutrition.
- TRUST Award: Centers on religious life, culture, and community.
- Supernova Award: Recognizes achievements in STEM fields. 


### Specific Rank & Award Colors

`The ALPS ranks follow a "Precious Metal" progression, while the specialty awards use distinct ribbon colors.`

#### Leadership Award Ribbons (VLA)
`The Leadership awards use a "Red, White, and Blue" logic based on the level of the organization.`

**Note**: `Because these are physical items (thread and metal), the color can shift slightly depending on the light. If you are using these for a graphic design project, I recommend using #004824 (Green) and #FCD116 (Yellow) as your primary "Hero" colors.`
