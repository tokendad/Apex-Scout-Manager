**Important note:**
Each council has different cookies based on which bakery it uses. So the cookies will need to be tailored and adjusted each year. An option to update cookie names and flavors will need to be added. This Quick Reference is primarily focused on the Central MA Council.

A new "Cookie" Dashboard may be created for this. This can display the individual sales and Troop sales based on permission level.

> **Note**: While Girl Scouts sell cookies, Scouting America/Cub Scouts sell popcorn. So this "cookie" dashboard should only be displayed for users in the Girl Scout Troops.  A placeholder "Popcorn" name can be used for the Scouting America/Cub Scouts

Cookies are primarily counted by two numbers: Cases and Boxes. There are 12 boxes per case. Scouts can order for their personal inventory and for their personal sales, cases or boxes.

Bakers: Girl Scout cookies are produced by two different licensed bakers [ABC Bakers](https://www.abcbakers.com/) and [Little Brownie Bakers](https://www.littlebrowniebakers.com/), which can lead to slight variations in count, size, and name.

The person in charge of the cookies is the Service Unit Cookie Manager (SUCM). This title will need to be added to the permissions matrix.

Primary Sales paths:

- Individual sales
   - In person
   - Digital via Online Cookie store
       - https://digitalcookie.girlscouts.org/
       
       There are 3 types of Digital cookie sales:
          - Ordered online / Delivered in person
          - Ordered online / Shipped Online
          - Donation: Customers buy the cookies from a girl (or online) and the troop or council handles the distribution of the cookies to the designated charity.
  
- Troop Booth
  > Troop Booths are held with 2 or more Girl Scouts. It is important not to have more than 5 girls present at a troop booth so that customers are not overwhelmed with requests and the girls can concentrate on their selling skills. It is required that two CORI’D, registered adults are present at the booth.

- Family Booth
   > Family Booths are 1 girl and her parent/guardian. This is typically a girl who has a higher goal. We ask that the parent/guardian at least register with GSCWM to do the booths. There are no additional girls allowed at the booth. Any additional girls would make it a troop booth and then you will need to have two CORI’D, registered adults.

- Council Booths
  > Council Booths are set up usually through the corporate office level at a business or at the request of the business themselves. All of the council booths are entered into eBudde and are available for all troops in our council to choose. Council Booths are the only booths that troops do not enter themselves into eBudde and where the unit does not need to contact the “home” unit to notify them of the location.


Girls can set "Goals" on how many boxes they can sell. Individual sales, Digital sales, and Family Booth Sales all count toward their goal.

Troops can set a "Troop Goal" and every sale from Troop booths and individual scouts is counted toward this goal.
