## Local Council
A Girl Scout local council is an independently chartered, legally incorporated organization responsible for managing, delivering, and supporting the Girl Scout program within a specific geographic area. 
[Official Council Finder](https://www.girlscouts.org/en/council-finder.html)


There are **111 councils in the USA**, staffed to support volunteers, maintain camp properties, and manage activities like cookie sales.

### Key Aspects
* **Structure & Governance:** Councils are organized as corporations in their respective states and operate under a charter from Girl Scouts of the USA (GSUSA). They are overseen by a Board of Directors and supported by local staff.
* **Purpose:** Their role is to advance the Girl Scout mission locally by providing leadership, administration, and supervision of the program, including training, support, and resources for girls and volunteers.
* **Geographic Scope:** A council's jurisdiction can range from a single county to multiple states. They often divide their territory into smaller areas known as service units or neighborhoods.

### Key Responsibilities
* **Program Delivery:** Organizing, promoting, and running activities, badge-earning opportunities, and events.
* **Camp/Property Maintenance:** Managing local camps, service centers, and retail shops.
* **Membership Management:** Registering and supporting local Girl Scouts and adult volunteers.
* **Financial Operations:** Managing local budgets, including the logistics and profits of the annual cookie program.

## The Service Unit (SU)

### Definition
A Service Unit is a community of volunteers and families within a defined geographic area—typically a cluster of schools, zip codes, or towns—that serves as the essential link between individual troops and their regional Girl Scout Council.

> **The Family Analogy:** While a troop acts as a member's "nuclear family," the Service Unit is the "extended family" providing the local support system necessary for a high-quality Girl Scout experience.

### Core Purpose & Responsibilities
The Service Unit is responsible for the overall health and growth of Girl Scouting in its community through several key functions:

* **Volunteer Support & Mentorship:** Acting as the first line of contact for troop leaders to provide mentorship, training, and troubleshooting.
* **Membership & Recruitment:** Leading local efforts to recruit new girls and adults, forming new troops, and placing members into existing groups.
* **Product Program Logistics:** Coordinating the local execution of the Girl Scout Cookie Program and Fall Product Program, including training troop managers and distributing rewards.
* **Community Events:** Organizing large-scale local activities such as Camporees, bridging ceremonies, and World Thinking Day celebrations that allow girls from different troops to connect.

### The Service Unit Team
To be considered "active" or "in good standing," a unit is typically led by a team of at least three to five volunteers in specialized roles:

* **Service Unit Manager (SUM):** Leads the team, facilitates monthly meetings, and maintains the primary connection to Council staff.
* **Treasurer:** Manages the service unit's bank account and assists troop leaders with annual financial reporting.
* **Product Manager:** Oversees the ordering, delivery, and financial tracking of cookies and fall products for all local troops.
* **Recruiter/Registrar:** Manages membership data, assists with the registration process, and identifies new recruitment opportunities.
* **Event Coordinator:** Plans and executes community-wide programs that align with the Girl Scout Leadership Experience.

### Communication Hub
Service Units generally hold **monthly meetings** where troop representatives gather to receive Council updates, share resources, network with other leaders, and collaborate on local initiatives.

## 3. The Girl Scout Troop

### Definition
The Troop is the fundamental unit of the Girl Scout experience. It is a group of girls, typically of similar grade levels, led by volunteer adult leaders. The troop provides a safe, consistent space for girls to discover their interests, connect with others, and take action to make the world a better place.

> **The Nuclear Family:** If the Service Unit is the "extended family," the **Troop** is the "nuclear family" where the closest friendships are formed and the day-to-day Girl Scout experience happens.

### Core Characteristics
* **Grade Levels:** Troops can be **single-level** (e.g., all Brownies) or **multi-level** (e.g., Daisies and Brownies together). Levels range from Daisy (Grades K-1) to Ambassador (Grades 11-12).
* **Leadership:** Two unrelated, background-checked adults (at least one of whom must be female) must be present for all meetings and activities to ensure safety.
* **Size:** Troop sizes vary, but typically range from 5 to 15+ girls to ensure a diversity of thought and cooperative learning.

### Key Activities & Responsibilities
* **Regular Meetings:** Gatherings (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly) where girls work on badges, Journeys, and team-building activities.
* **Girl-Led Governance:** As girls get older, they take increasing responsibility for planning activities, managing the troop budget (from cookie sales), and making decisions.
* **Community Service:** Engaging in "Take Action" projects to solve problems in their local community.
* **Outdoor Experience:** Camping, hiking, and exploring nature.

### Troop Leadership Team (Volunteers)
While parents often help out, specific roles are required to keep the troop running:
* **Troop Leader/Co-Leader:** The primary mentors who facilitate meetings and guide the girls through the program.
* **Troop Treasurer:** Oversees the troop's finances and maintains the bank account.
* **Troop Cookie Manager:** Manages the logistics, inventory, and rewards of the cookie sale for the troop.
