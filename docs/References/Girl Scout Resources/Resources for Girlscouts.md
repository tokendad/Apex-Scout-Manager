### LeaderShip Roles

**Adult Volunteer Titles**
***Every troop is required to have at least two registered, unrelated adult leaders. Common titles include:***

- Troop Leader / Co-Leader: The primary volunteers who mentor the troop, plan meetings, and facilitate the Girl Scout Leadership Experience (GSLE).
- Troop Treasurer: Manages the troop's bank account, tracks expenses, and files annual financial reports.
- Troop Cookie Manager (or Fall Product Manager): Coordinates the troop’s participation in product sales, including inventory and goal setting.
- Troop Admin: Handles internal communications, registrations, and acts as a liaison with the local Service Unit.
- Program Coordinator: Works with girls to develop a "Troop Year Plan" and organizes specific activities or badges.
- Outdoor / Camp-Trained Adult: A volunteer with specific safety and outdoor training required for camping trips and excursions. 

**Youth Leadership Positions**
***As Girl Scouts reach the Junior level (grades 4–5) and above, they take on formal leadership titles to manage their own troop affairs:***

- President: Leads meetings and oversees troop business.
Vice President: Assists the president and leads in their absence.
- Secretary: Records meeting minutes and tracks attendance.
- Treasurer: Helps manage the troop's funds and budget.
- Patrol Leader: In larger troops, girls may be divided into smaller "patrols," each with its own elected leader.
